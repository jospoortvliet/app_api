Installation
============

Following the release, the AppAPI will be accessible through the App Store.
Additionally, in the context of Nextcloud AIO, it will come pre-installed within the system.

Therefore, to install it on Nextcloud **27.1** or later, just install it from the store like any other application.

To install it in development mode, follow the instructions on this page: :ref:`dev-setup`.

Upon the successful installation of the AppAPI, a one-time configuration is essential.
Details on this configuration can be found in the subsequent section: :ref:`create-deploy-daemon`.

Best of luck!
